# Visual-Tracking-Project-ECE271B-WI19

This is the Github repository for our Statistical Learning II course project, Object Tracking with Optimized Online Multiple Instance Learning. 

Our modified version of MIL tracker can be found in [MILTrack](/MILTrack). Complete benchmark results can be found in [Results](/MILTrack/Combined_fig). 

The MATLAB version of weighted MIL tracker on which we based our implementation can be found in WMIL_base. The readme.txt in that folder contains original author information. 

KCC-base and KCF_base contain our earlier experiments with KCC tracker and KCF tracker, but these paths were not further pursued.
